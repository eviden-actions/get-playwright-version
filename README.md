# get-playwright-version

This parses the your project's lockfile and returns the installed playwright version.
Supported are `package-lock.json` (NPM), `yarn.lock` (Yarn 1), and `pnpm-lock.yaml` (PNPM).

If you are using the [Playwright Docker Image](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/playwright/about) in your CI, Playwright strongly recommends using a [versioned tag](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker). This action can help you make sure your project's Playwright version matches the Playwright Docker Image version.
